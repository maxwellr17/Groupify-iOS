#Groupify

Groupify allows Spotify users to become digital jukeboxes, which other users can control using an intuitive texting interface. When Groupify is enabled, other users can add their favorite songs to the playback queue, which will play automatically. When there isn't a song in the queue, a playlist specified by the host will play instead.

I worked on this project alongside Noah Rubin and Will Gulian. This repository contains only the Groupify iOS client code, cloned from @nrubin29. See more at https://devpost.com/software/groupify-ucdztr
